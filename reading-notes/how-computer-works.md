# How a Computer Works

Computers are tools that help us with manual work  by moving information around. Computers have 4 tasks:

* Input - Tells the computer what to do
* Store Information - Stores memory
* Process Information - Computes
* Process Results - Displays a variety of things such as text, photos, videos, games, virtual reality, signals to control a robot.

Computers started out as calculators

### Data and Binary

`1` and `0` play a big role in computers. It signals onn or off, yes or no, true or false.

Any number can be represented as binary. Example:

`1 0 0 1` is equal to `9`

32 wires can store from 0 to over 4 billion.

Text/images/sound can also be represented in numbers.

Images in Binary: images are made out of pixels represented by `RGB (0,0,0)`.

Sounds are series of vibrations in the air. Any point of the waveform can be represented as numbers. The higher the bits is equal to higher range of numbers. High quality sound is 32 bits. 

Binary numbers are the backbone of computers. 

### Circuits and Logic

Input or output is a type of information. Electrical circuits are electrical signals that flip on or off. Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different results. 

Logic gates:

* And -- Nand
* Not -- Nor
* Or -- Xor

Adder - Takes bits and adds together. 

The smaller the computer, the faster it is because travels less distance in the circuit board. 

### Memory and CPU

Central Processing Unit (CPU) - Master Control. It tells which cicuit to use and when to use them. 
Modern computers run multiple CPUs to process input. 

* Hardware - chips and circuits
* Software - Code, websites, games
