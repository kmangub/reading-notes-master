## Text Editor

A text editor is a software that can be downloaded to write and manage text. Some examples of text editors are:

* Notepad ++
* Text Wrangler
* BB Edit
* Visual Studio Code
* Atom
* Brackets
* Sublime Text

> Text editors come with the computer you choose. You can customize it to your liking.

## Features

Some of the important features are:

* Code Completion
* Syntax Highlighting
* Nice variety of themes
* Ability to choose a variety of selections

## Integrated Development Environment 

Think of Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as different softwares coming together in harmony. The difference between IDE and text editors is that text editors just edits text and IDE has a lot more functions.

## Terminals

Text base interface to the system. 

> The way it works is that you type a command and your computer pwerforms that action.

Below are a list of useful commands to remember:

   * `pwd` - print working directory
   * `ls` - list
   * `cd` - change directories

> Tip: You can press the up arrow key to scroll through previously used commands.

## Paths

Paths enable us to navigate through files. There are two different types of paths:

   * Absolute Path - Specify a location in relation to **the root directory**

   * Relative Path - Specify a location in relation to **where we are in the system**

Root directory is the top of the structure denoted by a `/`

`~` is a shortcut to home directory
`.` is your current directory
`..` is your parent directory

> You can use any method to get back to a location. There's more than one right answer!

## Files

Spaces in files are okay if you are refering to two or more files; it only affects the naming scheme. In order to fix that, we use quotes to count it as a single item. 

> Tip: Backslash `\` means to nullify the next character.

To make a directory hidden, start with a `.` for the file name.

Here are some more useful commands:

   * `file` - get information on a file or directory
   * `ls -a` - list contents, including hidden files
    
> Tip: Terminals are case-sensitive.
