My name is *Karlo Mangubat* and I currently reside in Yokosuka, Japan. I got my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Jacksonville University, FL. Afterwards, I graduated Officer Candidate School in Newport, RI and was assigned to *USS STETHEM* (DDG 63) to serve as a Main Propulsion Officer. I separated from the Navy and now I work as a contractor as a Supply Technician for Yoksosuka Ship Repair Facility.

I did a little bit of coding while pursuing my degree. I have experience in C# and LaTeX.

My hobbies include playing video games, working out, and traveling to different countries. What I hope to gain in this class is to meet a lot of people and gain more experience in the tech world.
