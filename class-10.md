# Images

In this chapter, we will go over images and how to re-size them. We will also learn how to align images and to add it as a background.

We can control the the size of the images using the `width:` and `height:` properties. 

To float images, we use the `float:` property. If we want the text to fall on the left side of the image, we use `float: right` and vice versa.

To put text over an image, we can use the `background-image:` property followed by the file path to the image file, or the url. We can also have the images repeat using the `background-repeat:` property followed by `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`, `no-repeat`, `fixed`, or `scroll`.

We can control the positioning of the image with `background-position:` with the following:

- `left top`
- `left center`
- `left bottom`
- `center top`
- `center center`
- `center bottom`
- `right top`
- `right center`
- `right bottom`
