# Intro to Django

Django is a framework used to create secure websites. 
With Django, we have access to multiple features included below:

- Object-relational mapper
    - We can use Python to define data models and database access API and can write SQL as needed. 

- URLs and views
    - Django encourages nice URL design by creating a Python module called a `URLconf`

- Forms
    - Like HTML, Django offers libraries that render forms, validating their data, and translating it over to native Python types.

- Authentication
    - Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions.

- Admin 
    - Django features admin interface for content producers and can immediately manage content on the webpage. 

- Internationalization
    - Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.

- Security 
    - Django provides multiple protections against Clickjacking, Cross-site scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), SQL injection, and Remote code execution.

# How Django Works Behind the Scenes

Django is an open source and it is available on Github, but the issues that come up are funding and control. Some of the funding comes from corporate sponsers, solo, and non-profit.

The Django Software Foundation (DSF) maintains Django in numbers of ways, one being the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and perform the work needed to keep Django alive.

Django also has volunteers who manage the technical side of the Django Project such as the Django Project website itself, the official issue tracker, official mailing lists, IRC channels, and more.
