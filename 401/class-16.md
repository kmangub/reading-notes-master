# Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

**Encrypting** a message is sending the message to someone where only you and the person you're sending it to can undertand. 

**Caesar Cipher** is taking the alphabet and shifting it over n times to and substituting that letter.

**Decryption** may or may not be the same shifted alphabet to substitute and read the message. It's just working backwards. 

**Frequency analysis** is checking to see each letter and analyzing it to determine if the letter "e", which is the popular letter in the english language, and narrow down the shift

**Plain text** is when it is already known what some parts of the text, making it easier to crack the rest of the code

**Brute Force** is when you're trying one shift and seeing if it works. If not, then move to the next shift. This repeats until whatever you're deciphering makes sense.
