Tips for success at a whiteboard interview:

- Communicate by regurgitating the question. This ensures that we fully answer the question.
- Talk about what the expected input and outputs are.
- Ask about edge cases.
- Write Pseudo Code to ensure we cover all edge cases.
- If we get stuck, say something like, "I'm unsure on what to do at this point. Do you have any tips to point me in the right direction?"   
- Ask the point of contact on what to expect for the interview. 

# 7 Tips to Ace a Programming Interview

1. Don't start talking right away. Actually take a moment and think about the problem.
2. Write down the steps of the solution (algorithm)
3. Write Pseudo Code first to resolve any issues
4. Don't sweat the small stuff and focus on the big picture. If we forgot a method name, let the interviewer know by saying "I forgot what the method is called and this is where I would google it."
5. Sit down and be humble. The interview is also an assessment on how we take critism and how we might collaborate with other team members.
6. Come prepared. 
7. Review your work. If we finish early, take some time to look at any errors on our code or look for ways to optimize Big O. Fastest is Hashtables.
